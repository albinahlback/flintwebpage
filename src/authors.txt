<h3>Brief project history</h3>

<p>FLINT has been developed since 2007 by a large number of people.
Initially the library was started by David Harvey and William Hart.
Later maintenance of the library was taken over solely by William Hart,
who remained the project leader until 2022.</p>

<p>FLINT 2.0 was a clean rewrite from scratch done around 2010 by William Hart,
Sebastian Pancratz and Fredrik Johansson. Eventually, the 2.x series greatly
expanded the scope of FLINT with new features such as finite fields
(implemented by Mike Hansen) and multivariate polynomials (Daniel Schultz),
just to mention two examples.</p>

<p>FLINT 3.0, released in 2023, merged three spin-off projects which were
previously maintained as separate libraries: Arb and Calcium (started by
Fredrik Johansson in 2012 and 2020), and Antic (started by William Hart in
2013). The author list below includes people who contributed to those projects.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="https://portal.cfarm.net/">cfarm compile farm</a> project has generously
provided FLINT developers access to machines for
architecture-specific testing.</li>

<li>
Some code (notably longlong.h and clz_tab.c) has been used from the GMP library,
whose main author is Torbjorn Granlund. FLINT also includes code from the MPFR
library developed by Guillaume Hanrot, Vincent Lefèvre, Patrick Pélissier,
Philippe Théveny, Paul Zimmermann and others.
