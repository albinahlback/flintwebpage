<p>2015-08-12: FLINT 2.5.1 is released!</p>

<p>This fixes a number of build issues for various platforms, including OSX
and Windows MSVC.</p>

<p>2015-08-07: FLINT 2.5 is released!</p>

<p>2015-02-17: FLINT 2.4.5 is released. This fixed a severe bug in flint's
heuristic GCD which would affect polynomial GCD over ZZ and QQ where one of
the inputs had a very small linear factor. The bug was only triggered in
extremely rare situations. We strongly recommend updating.

<p>2014-06-19: FLINT 2.4.4 is released. This fixed a <u>severe</u> bug in
flint's primality code (n_is_prime() affecting n_factor()). We strongly
recommend updating as all versions of flint since 1.1 are affected.</p>
