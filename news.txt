<h3>Past news and events</h3>

<p>2015-02-17: FLINT 2.4.5 is released. This fixed a severe bug in flint's
heuristic GCD which would affect polynomial GCD over ZZ and QQ where one of
the inputs had a very small linear factor. The bug was only triggered in
extremely rare situations. We strongly recommend updating.
