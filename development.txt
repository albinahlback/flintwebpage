<h3>Development ideas</h3>

<p>Our GitHub issue tracker: <a href="https://github.com/flintlib/flint2/issues">https://github.com/flintlib/flint2/issues</a></p>

<p>Here is a list of ideas for development projects
that would be highly valuable to a large number of users.
Some of these could
make good student projects (or in some cases, research projects).
</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve FLINT's linear algebra performance by wrapping BLAS for matrix multiplication.</li>
<li>Implement a small primes FFT that takes advantage of vectorisation, to speed up integer and polynomial arithmetic.</li>
<li>Write a tuning framework to automatically select algorithm thresholds on different architectures.</li>
<li>Work on assembly optimisations for specific architectures.</li>
<li>Sparse linear algebra (currently in progress)</li>
</ul>

<p>
A longer list of (mostly minor) issues to work on can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/flintlib/flint2/blob/trunk/todo.txt">todo.txt</a> file.
