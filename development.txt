<h3>Mailing list</h3>

<p>...and discuss development ideas with us at our Google development group:</p>

<h3>Development ideas</h3>

<p>Our GitHub issue tracker: <a href="https://github.com/flintlib/flint/issues">https://github.com/flintlib/flint/issues</a></p>

<p>Here are some of ideas for development projects
that would be highly valuable to a large number of users.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve FLINT's linear algebra performance using vectorization.</li>
<li>Write a tuning framework to automatically select algorithm thresholds on different architectures.</li>
<li>Work on assembly optimisations for specific architectures.</li>
<li>Sparse linear algebra.</li>
<li>Improve algorithms for dealing with exact algebraic and transcendental numbers.</li>
<li>Low-precision interval arithmetic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A longer list of (mostly minor) issues to work on can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/flintlib/flint/blob/trunk/todo.txt">todo.txt</a> file.
