<p>FLINT has been developed since 2007 by a large number of people. Initially
the library was started by David Harvey and William Hart. Later maintenance
of the library was taken over solely by William Hart.</p>

<li>In addition Michael Abshoff, William Stein and Robert Bradshaw have
contributed to the build system of FLINT.</li>

<li>Michael Abshoff deserves special recognition for his help in
resolving a number of difficult build issues which came to light as FLINT was
incorporated into SAGE and for bringing numerous bugs to the attention of the
FLINT maintainers. Michael regularly checked FLINT for memory leaks and
corruption, which directly led to numerous issues being identified early!
He also helped with setting up various pieces of infrastructure for the FLINT
project.</li>

<li>Numerous people have contributed to wrapping FLINT in Sage and
debugging, including Mike Hansen, Jean-Pierre Flori, Burcin Erocal, Robert
Bradshaw, Martin Albrecht, Sebastian Pancratz, Fredrik Johansson, Jeroen
Demeyer and Leif Lionhardy, amongst others.</li>

<li>Some code (notably longlong.h and clz_tab.c) has been used from
the GMP library, whose main author is Torbjorn Granlund.</li>

</ul>

FLINT 2 was a complete rewrite from scratch which began in about 2010.
