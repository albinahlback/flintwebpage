<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>FLINT is a C library for doing number theory, maintained by <a href="mailto:hart_wb {at_thingy} yahoo dot com">William Hart</a>.
FLINT is licensed <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GPL v2+</a>.</p>

<p>FLINT supports arithmetic with numbers, polynomials, power series and matrices over many base rings, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiprecision integers and rationals</li>
<li>Integers modulo <i>n</i></li>
<li>p-adic numbers</li>
<li>Finite fields (prime and non-prime order)</li>
<li>Real and complex numbers (via the <a href="http://fredrikj.net/arb/">Arb</a> extension library)</li>
</ul>

<p>Support is also currently being developed for algebraic number fields (via the <a href="https://github.com/wbhart/antic/">Antic</a> extension library).</p>

<p>Operations that can be performed include conversions, arithmetic, computing GCDs, factoring, solving linear systems, and evaluating special functions. In addition, FLINT provides various low-level routines for fast arithmetic. FLINT is extensively documented and tested.</p>

<p>FLINT is written in ANSI C and runs on many platforms (including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows on common hardware configurations), but is currently mostly optimised for x86 and x86-64 CPUs. It is designed to be threadsafe. FLINT depends on the <a href="http://mpir.org">MPIR</a>/<a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> and <a href="http://mpfr.org">MPFR</a> libraries.</p>

<p>FLINT has been used for large scale computations in number theory research (for example: <a href="http://www.aimath.org/news/congruentnumbers/">A Trillion Triangles</a>), and is also suited as a general-purpose backend for computer algebra systems. <a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a> uses FLINT as the default package for polynomial arithmetic over Z, Q and Z/<i>n</i>Z for small <i>n</i>, and work is currently underway to use FLINT in <a href="http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/">Singular</a> and <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/">Macaulay2</a>.</p>
